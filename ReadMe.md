Remake of the Star Story game for Scyndi's Creative Interpreter

====

Join Wendicka Lovejoy and Crystal McLeen as they embark on a journey through space.
Solve the many mysteries that haunt them on the way, and save the universe from a great evil.

Star Story is an RPG in a nice science fiction environment, in which a lot of famous franchizes in the genre are parodied, but which still holds a good and strong story, with a deep plot and character development.
